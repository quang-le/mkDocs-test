# Welcome to Iaso

Iaso is a georegistry and data collection web platform structured around
trees of organization units (also known a master lists)

The main tasks it allows accomplishing are:

-   Data collection using [XLSForm](https://xlsform.org/) forms linked
    to org units through a mobile application.
-   Import, comparison and merging of multiple Org Units' trees, both
    through a web application and an API allowing manipulation through
    data science tools like [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
-   Validation of received data for Org Units' trees and forms.
-   Exports of the Org Units' trees and form data, either in csv, xlsx,
    [GeoPackage](https://www.geopackage.org/) or through an api.
